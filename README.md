# Introduction-To-C#

# C# Type Casting
# Type casting is when you assign a value of one data type to another type.

# In C#, there are two types of casting:

# Implicit Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
# char -> int -> long -> float -> double

# Explicit Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
# double -> float -> long -> int -> char



# Type Conversion Methods
# It is also possible to convert data types explicitly by using built-in methods, 
# such as Convert.ToBoolean, Convert.ToDouble, Convert.ToString, Convert.ToInt32 (int) and Convert.ToInt64 (long):




/*

Data type-
int     4 bytes	Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long	8 bytes	Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float	4 bytes	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
double	8 bytes	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
bool	1 bit	Stores true or false values
char	2 bytes	Stores a single character/letter, surrounded by single quotes
string	2 bytes per character	Stores a sequence of characters, surrounded by double quotes
