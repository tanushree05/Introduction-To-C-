# Introduction-To-C#
# C# Type Casting
# Type casting is when you assign a value of one data type to another type.

# In C#, there are two types of casting:

# Implicit Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
# char -> int -> long -> float -> double

# Explicit Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
# double -> float -> long -> int -> char



# Type Conversion Methods
# It is also possible to convert data types explicitly by using built-in methods, 
# such as Convert.ToBoolean, Convert.ToDouble, Convert.ToString, Convert.ToInt32 (int) and Convert.ToInt64 (long):
